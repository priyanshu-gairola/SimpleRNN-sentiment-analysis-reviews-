# SimpleRNN-sentiment-analysis-reviews-

This project utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to perform sentiment analysis on textual data. The model classifies text (e.g., customer reviews, social media posts) as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed.

Objective: Analyze textual data to determine the underlying sentiment.

Model:
RNN architecture with embedding layers to capture word relationships.

Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, featuring LSTM or GRU layers for better handling of sequential dependencies.

Dataset: Preprocessed text data tokenized into sequences, padded for uniformity, and split into training and testing sets.

Features:

Preprocessing pipeline: Tokenization, stopword removal, and sequence padding.
Accurate sentiment predictions with robust handling of sequential data.
Options for fine-tuning hyperparameters and transfer learning.

Technologies Used:

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the RNN.
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): For text preprocessing.
Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
